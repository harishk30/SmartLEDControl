# SmartLEDControl

Python script to take user requests from ChatGPT and convert it to LED patterns using a WS2812B LED strip connected to a Raspberry PI. Additionally, connects to users' spotify and dynamically controls LED lights based on tempo, loudness, and beats of the song. 

User requests can be a theme they want the LED lights to match, or a Spotify song they want the LED lights to sync to.
